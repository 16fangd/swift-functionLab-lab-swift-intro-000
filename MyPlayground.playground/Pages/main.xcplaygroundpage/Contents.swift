/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?

/*: question5
 ### 5. Write a function that declares a _variable_ inside the function's body. Print that variable to the console, then assign it to a new variable and print it again. Call your function several times. What do you think happens each time you call your function? Will it print the same thing?
