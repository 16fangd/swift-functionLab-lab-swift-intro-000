# Function Lab


## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Write their own functions which solidify what we've been telling them in prior readme's where a function should do one thing and one thing well.
* Call on functions they've written themselves to see the output.




## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Knows how to use the print function (although they might not know that it's referred to as a function at this point).
* Can create variables of type String and Int (no other types).
* They will have just come from a reading about functions.



## Outline / Notes

*  The prior reading will introduce them to functions. Challenge them to create functions VERY similar to what they have just seen in the [Prior reading](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-functions-readme)
*  Build in complexity with the later questions.
* I like the idea of having the last question or two be something we didn't show them yet? I'm unsure if this is a good idea but I do want to throw them in a place where they feel challenged and have to use google or stack overflow. Maybe we even word it that way to the student.
